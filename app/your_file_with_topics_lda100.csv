He who slays a believer by mistake, when he meant to strike some other thing, as in the case of hunting or [shooting at] trees, but then happens to strike him with what in most cases would not kill, then let him set free, let him emancipate, a believing slave (raqaba denotes nasama, `a person'), an obligation on him, and blood-money is to be submitted, to be paid, to his family, that is, the slain person's inheritors, unless they remit it as a charity, to him by waiving [their claim to] it. In the Sunna this [blood-money] is explained as being equivalent to one hundred camels: twenty pregnant, twenty female sucklings, twenty male sucklings, twenty mature ones and twenty young ones [not more than five years old]; and [the Sunna stipulates] that it is incumbent upon the killer's clan, namely, his paternal relations [and not other relatives]. They share this [burden of the blood-money] over three years; the rich among them pays half a dinar, while the one of moderate means [pays] a quarter of a dinar each year; if they still cannot meet this, then it can be taken from the treasury, and if this is not possible, then from the killer himself. If he, the slain, belongs to a people at enmity, at war, with you and is a believer, then the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer, as a redemption, but no bloodmoney is to be paid to his family, since they are at war [with you]. If he, the slain, belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant, a treaty, as is the case with the Protected People (ahl al-dhimma), then the blood-money, for him, must be paid to his family, and it constitutes a third of the blood-money for a believer, if the slain be a Jew or a Christian, and two thirds of a tenth of it, if he be a Magian; and the setting free of a believing slave, is incumbent upon the slayer. But if he has not the wherewithal, for [setting free] a slave, failing to find one, or the means to obtain one, then the fasting of two successive months, is incumbent upon him as a redemption: here God does not mention the transition to [an alternative to fasting which is] giving food [to the needy], as in the case of [repudiating one's wife by] zihr, something which al- Shfi` advocates in the more correct of two opinions of his; a relenting from God (tawbatan, `relenting', is the verbal noun, and is in the accusative because of the implied verb).

It is reported from Ibn `Abbs that it [the verse] should be understood as it stands, abrogating other verses of `forgiveness'.

It is made clear in the Sunna that between the intentional and the unintentional, there is a type of killing that is identified as [being with] quasi-deliberate intent (shibh al- `amd), where the killer has slain with what in most cases is not [a] lethal [implement]. In such a case, there is no [right to] retaliation and blood-money is paid instead, so that it [this type of killing] is described as intentional, but [considered] unintentional in [that there applies] the fixing of the period [for payment] and the sharing of the burden [by the killer's clan]; in this [case] and that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.",250,0.29222965240478516

The Prophet (s) made the two swear oaths. The bowl was later discovered in Mecca, where the owners said that they had bought it from Tamm and `Udayy. The next verse was then revealed, after which two of the Sahm man's close kin came to swear their oaths; in al-Tirmidh's version, `Amr b. al-`s, who was closer to the deceased man, stood up with one other from among the kin, and they swore an oath; in yet another version, the [Sahm] man fell ill and instructed them as to his bequest and asked them to deliver what he had left to his family, but when he died, they took the bowl [and sold it] and then gave what remained [of that money] to his family.",214,0.13872763514518738

Thus He [God] was gracious to him by way of [carrying him on] the night journey, which comprised his encountering the [other] prophets, his ascension to heaven and the sight of the marvels of the [Divine] Realm and His communion, exalted be He, with him. For he [the Prophet] (s) said: `I was brought al-Burq, a white animal, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; it was able to place its hoof [back] towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until I reached the Holy House [of Jerusalem]. [There] I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets fasten [their animals]. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out, Gabriel came to me with a jug of wine and a jug of milk, and so I chose the milk.

He replied, ""Gabriel"", ""And who is with you?"", ""Muhammad (s)"", he said. ""Has he been called forth?"". ""Yes, he has been called forth"". And it was opened up for us, and lo! there were the two [maternal] cousins, John and Jesus. They greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the third heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked, ""Who are you?"". He replied, ""Gabriel"", ""And who is with you?"", ""Muhammad (s)"", he said. ""Has he been sent for?"" it was asked. ""Yes, he has been sent for"". And it was opened up for us, and lo! there was Joseph standing before me, and indeed he had been given one half of all beauty!

""Has he been called forth?"", it was asked. ""Yes, he has been called forth"". And it was opened up for us, and lo! there before me was Moses. He greeted me and prayed for well-being for me.

When some command of God's enveloped it, it changed, and lo! none of God's creation could describe it for all its beauty'. He [the Prophet] continued: `God then revealed to me what He revealed and prescribed for me fifty prayers each day and night. I then descended until I reached Moses and he said, ""What has your Lord prescribed for your community?"" I said, ""Fifty prayers each day and night"". He said, ""Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation, for your community will not have the capacity for it: I have tried the Children of Israel and have experience of them [not being up to the task]."" I then went back to my Lord and said, ""My Lord! Lighten that [prescription] for my community"", and so He reduced it for me by five. I went back to Moses who asked me, ""What did you do?"". I said to him, `He has reduced it for me by five', to which he said, ""Your community will not have the capacity for this; so go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community"". Thus I kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses, with Him reducing it by five each time until He said, ""O Muhammad (s)! They shall be five prayers each day and night, every prayer will be worth [the reward of] ten [prayers]; that then makes fifty prayers. And whoever intends a good deed but does not perform it, I shall count it for him as one [done]; and if he performs it, I shall count it for him as ten; and whoever intends an evil deed, but does not perform it, it shall not be recorded against him; but if he performs it, it shall be recorded [only] as one evil deed"". I then descended until I reached Moses. I informed him and he said, ""Go back to your Lord and ask Him for an alleviation for your community, because your community will not have the capacity for this""; and I said, ""I have gone back to my Lord so many times that I am ashamed [to go again]"".

The author of this [commentary] says, `This [last commentary] constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur'n composed by the inquisitive scholar, the shaykh, Imam Jall al-Dn al- Mahall al-Shfi`, may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively, [especially] in those precious things that I have deemed, God willing, to be profitable. I composed it [this commentary] in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God [sc. Moses] and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It [this commentary] actually draws on the work which it complements, relying and depending on it for [an understanding of] those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality, chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said: ""I praise God, my Lord, for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who [other than God] is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter"". In fact, it never occurred to me to embark upon such [a task], knowing that I was incapable of delving into such issues. Perhaps God will make it of ample profit [to others] and through it open sealed hearts, blinded eyes and deaf ears. I have the impression that I am before those [sort of readers] who would prefer works of prolixity, refraining from [referring to] this complementary work, rejecting it outright, tending to obvious obstinacy [regarding it], without addressing its intricacies with any understanding: And whoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter [Q. 17:72]. May God thereby provide us with a [way of] guidance to the path of truth, with success, an awareness of the subtle intricacies of His words and with an ascertainment. May He thereby also make us with those to whom God has been gracious from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous -- and excellent companions are they! [Q. 4:69]. He [Jall al-Dn al-Suyt] completed the composition of this [work] on Sunday, 10th of Shawwl, in the year 870 (AH) [1465 AD], having commenced it on the first Wednesday of Ramadn of the same year. He completed the fair copy [of this work] on Wednesday, 6th of Safar in the year 871 (AH) [1466 AD], and God knows best. Shaykh Shams al-Dn Muhammad b. Ab Bakr al-Khatb al-Tkh said: my friend the erudite shaykh Kaml al-Dn al-Mahall, brother of the above-mentioned shaykh of ours, shaykh Jall al-Dn al- Mahall, may God have mercy on both of them, that he saw his brother, the above-mentioned shaykh Jall al-Dn, in his dream: before him stood our friend the inquiring erudite scholar shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Suyt, compiler of this complement. He [Mahall] had this complement in his hand and, perusing it, he was saying to its above-mentioned compiler [Suyt], `Which of the two is better, my composition or yours?'. He [Suyt] said, `Mine'. He [Mahall] then said, `But look at this ...', and he showed him parts of it, politely pointing out to him his objections thereto. Each time he [Mahall] brought something up, the compiler of this complement [Suyt] would respond to him, while shaykh [Mahall] would smile and laugh. Our shaykh, the imam, the erudite scholar Jall al-Dn `Abd al-Rahmn b. Ab Bakr al-Suyt, compiler of this complement said: What I believe, and what I am absolutely certain of, is that the part composed by shaykh Jall al-Dn al-Mahall, may God have mercy on him, in his section [of the commentary] is actually better than mine by far. How [could it be otherwise], when most of what I have written here draws on his work and relies on it? I have no doubt about this. As regards what was seen in the above-mentioned dream, then perhaps it is the case that the shaykh meant to point out those few places in which I disagreed with what he had written on account of some little comment [that I had made therein]. But these [instances] are very few and I do not think that they add up to more than ten such instances. Among these is where shaykh [al-Mahall] comments in srat Sd: `The Spirit is a delicate organism (jism latf) that gives life to a human being by permeating it'. I followed this [opinion] at first, but then I remembered the restriction [made by God] while [working on the commentary] at srat al-Hijr; and so I erased it because of where God says, And they will question you concerning the Spirit. Say, `The Spirit is of the command of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little [...]' [to the end of] the verse [Q. 15:85]. For, it is explicit, or almost explicit, in stating that the [true nature of the] Spirit is of God's knowledge [only], exalted be He -- we do not know it. Thus, it is better that we should refrain from trying to define it. For this reason also, shaykh Tj al-Dn b. al-Subk says in [his work] Jam` al-jawmi` (The compendium of compendiums'): `As for the spirit, Muhammad (s) never spoke about it and we should [also] therefore refrain [from speaking about it].' Another [instance] is where the shaykh says in [his commentary to] srat al-Hajj [Q. 22:17], `The Sabaeans (al-sbi'n) are a Jewish sect'. I mention this in [my commentary to] srat al-Baqara [Q. 2:62], where I added the following [gloss] `or [they are] a Christian [sect]', in order to point out a variant opinion, generally acknowledged, particularly by our colleagues, the [Shfi`] jurists, and [also acknowledged] by the Minhj (`The Method [...]'), where it is stated that the Samaritans opposed the Jews and the Sabaeans [opposed] the Christians [respectively] over the fundamentals of their religion. In his [Mahall's] Sharh (`Commentary'), al-Shfi`, may God be pleased with him, is reported to have said that the Sabaeans were a Christian sect. At this moment, I cannot recall a third instance [of Mahall's objections]. Perhaps these are the sort of examples which the Shaykh, may God have mercy on him, was pointing out [in the dream]. And God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the return and the [final] resort.
